This is a sample Django application that provides a simple search for
 public record home sales data from Manhattan. The search interface makes use
 of the discovery_widgets project, an open source collection of jQuery widgets
 that use a pub/sub mechanism to manage search state (http://github.com/markschoate/discovery_widgets)

The project uses virtualenv, so once the project has been cloned, change into the project
directory and execute the bootstrap.py script in order to install the dependencies:

    ./bootstrap.py --clear --no-site-packages .

Once that is run, you should be able to change into the home_sales directory and enter
the following:

    ./manage.py runserver
